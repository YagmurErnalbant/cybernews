"November 02, 2022",Experts Warn of SandStrike Android Spyware Infecting Devices via Malicious VPN App," A previously undocumented Android spyware campaign has been found striking Persian-speaking individuals by masquerading as a seemingly harmless VPN application.  Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky is tracking the campaign under the moniker  SandStrike . It has not been attributed to any particular threat group.  ""SandStrike is distributed as a means to access resources about the  Bahá'í religion  that are banned in Iran,"" the company noted in its  APT trends report  for the third quarter of 2022.   While the app is ostensibly designed to provide victims with a VPN connection to bypass the ban, it's also configured to covertly siphon data from the victims' devices, such as call logs, contacts, and even connect to a remote server to fetch additional commands.  The booby-trapped VPN service, while fully functional, is said to be distributed via a Telegram channel controlled by the adversary.

The issues, tracked as  CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 , have been described as buffer overrun vulnerabilities that can be triggered during X.509 certificate verification by supplying a specially-crafted email address.
